## Overview

Given the COVID-19 restrictions, the Swedish government has implemented laws to prevent large gatherings and promote social distancing for public health safety. The government agency recommends thorough planning for events with fewer than 50 attendees. In line with this, park entertainment must follow these regulations. Thus, understanding expected attendance is crucial for compliance and effective planning.
