          <p>
            A passionate Design Technologist and Front-End Developer dedicated
            to crafting exceptional digital experiences through innovative
            design systems. With a keen eye for aesthetics and a strong

            spending my time in the design & tech community, and learning more
            about design, business, and technology. Aside from all that, I enjoy
            hiking, camping with friends, and trying new food recipes.

          <p>
            As a creative problem-solver with a love for technology, I found my
            true calling in the world of design and front-end development. My
            journey began with a burning curiosity for both design and code,
            leading me to pursue a degree in Master of Science in Interaction &
            Design from Ume√• University. Throughout my academic journey and
            professional career, I have honed my skills to bring out the best in
            every digital project I undertake.

          <h5>Design system</h5>
          <p>
            Experist in creating and maintaining design systems that document
            and organize design patterns, components, and guidelines which
            empower team to collaborate effectively and enable faster
            iterations, leading to a cohesive and harmonious user experience
            across products. My expertise in crafting design systems is
            instrumental in delivering exceptional digital experiences that
            resonate with users and leave a lasting impact on the market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Frontend</h5>
          <p>
            My expertise in frontend development enables me to convert design
            concepts into functional and visually appealing interfaces. I
            specialize in building UI components using different JavaScript
            Frameworks such as Angular and StencilJS (web components
            compiler).My design approach prioritizes inclusivity, employing ARIA
            roles and semantic HTML to ensure accessibility. Additionally, I
            have worked with creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to provide
            app-like experiences for users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>UX Design</h5>
          <p>
            My deep-rooted commitment to user-centric design is anchored in the
            principles of design thinking, with a core focus on placing the user
            at the center of every decision. This entails empathizing with
            users, conducting thorough user research, and gathering invaluable
            insights to inform design and development choices. By focusing on
            user needs, preferences, and pain points, I consistently craft
            intuitive and meaningful digital experiences that resonate
            profoundly with the target audience.
